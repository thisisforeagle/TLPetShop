      <h1>Our History</h1>
      <p>
        On April 17th 1868, the eventual owners of Pet Shop found seven stray
        puppies and kittens on the street. Not being able to handle all of them,
        they looked for friends to take care of them, but vowed to still help as
        much as they could, so a few weeks later, they opened the first location
        as a pet care centre.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        As word got out of this new establishment, demand for their services
        skyrocketed, forcing Pet Shop to evolve and provide a variety of new
        services. Nowadays, Pet Shop is the biggets pet company in Limerick, and
        they count with an inmense catalog of food, toys, and even pets!
